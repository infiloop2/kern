-- migrate:up
-- The Claude Code catalog (host/session_options.py) now offers exact model
-- ids instead of the unversioned aliases, so new threads record which model
-- generation they run. The alias values stay accepted here so that threads
-- created before this migration keep their stored model and stay readable;
-- the admin API refuses to run further tasks on them, and nothing new is
-- written with an alias.
